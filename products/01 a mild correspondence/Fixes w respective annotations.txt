Fixes w/ respective annotations:

1. Ensure that everything (the dropdown menu, decreaseQty & increaseQty + and - buttons, etc.) resets when the page refreshes.

2. The item image and info in the cart are aligned properly.

3. Bring back the previous trash can icon (all solid color).

4. Ensure the arrows and thumbnails click.

5. Ensure the main image slides accordingly when the arrows are clicked.

6. Add the feature to hold and swipe the main image in either direction to get to the other thumbnail.

7. Make everything fully global.

8. Make as many things future proof as possible, and rely on hard coding anything if you must as a backup. Please use the exact same names from my css such as ".pic-main" and not generic names such as "main-image img" as there aren't any "main-image img" parth in my html nor css.

9. Ensure that the checkout button leads to the default stripe checkout link.

10. Ensure the item metric: 10 unique items allowed in the bag at a time only, each w/ a max quantity of 5 only.

11. All items in the bag are still there after refreshing the page. The only way to remove them the bag is to manually dele them, and / or for the user to delete their respective cookies.

Please send the entire javascript ensuring these fixes.
