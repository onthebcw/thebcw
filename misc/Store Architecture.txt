Your Store Architecture Blueprint
1️⃣ Frontend: GitHub Pages

Purpose: Hosts your static files: HTML, CSS, JS.

Setup:

Push your website files to a GitHub repository.

Enable GitHub Pages on that repository.

Point your domain’s A or CNAME records (on Cloudflare) to GitHub Pages.

Notes:

GitHub Pages only serves static sites.

Dynamic backend logic (Stripe, Printful API) must run elsewhere (Cloudflare Workers in your case).



2️⃣ Backend: Cloudflare Workers + KV

Purpose: Handles your store logic, API requests, and order persistence.

Cloudflare Workers:

Serverless JS environment.

Handles requests like creating Stripe sessions, interacting with Printful API, and storing orders.

Cloudflare KV (Key-Value store):

Persistent storage for lightweight data (orders, product info, user sessions).

Free tier allows fast reads/writes globally.

Workflow Example:

User clicks “Buy Product” on frontend.

Frontend calls your Worker endpoint.

Worker:

Creates a Stripe session for digital or physical products.

Calls Printful API if it’s a physical product.

Saves order info in KV.

Worker returns checkout URL or QR code to frontend.



3️⃣ Payments: Stripe

Purpose: Accept payments for both digital and physical products.

Stripe Setup:

Use Stripe Payment Element:

Unified UI for credit cards, wallets, and other payment methods.

Automatically adapts to country-specific payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, QR code payments, etc.).

Worker creates a Stripe Checkout Session for each order.

Notes:

QR codes can be generated via Stripe’s Payment Links if desired.

Digital product delivery can be automated by sending a secure download link after payment.



4️⃣ Physical Products: Printful API

Purpose: Handle print-on-demand, dropshipping physical products.

APIs to use:

Catalog API → Get product variants, pricing, images.

Store API → Create orders, track shipments.

Workflow Example:

User buys a physical product.

Worker creates a Printful order via the Store API.

Printful handles fulfillment and shipping.

Worker saves the order info in KV for your tracking.



5️⃣ Domain & DNS: Cloudflare

Purpose: Connect everything under your custom domain.

Setup:

Domain’s A/CNAME records → GitHub Pages (frontend)

Domain’s MX/SPF/DKIM records → Titan Email (email)

Cloudflare also provides SSL/TLS and caching.



6️⃣ Email: Titan

Purpose: Use your custom email (hi@example.com) for business communication.

Setup:

Get Titan email through your registrar or another provider.

Configure MX, SPF, DKIM records in Cloudflare.

Access via Gmail or other email clients using IMAP/SMTP.

Notes:

No need for web hosting from Titan.

Works perfectly even if your website is on GitHub + Cloudflare Workers.



7️⃣ Multi-Language Support

Languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean.

Frontend: Handle via JavaScript language toggle or static multi-page approach.

Backend: Include language preference in order payload for email confirmations or receipts if needed.



8️⃣ Summary of Responsibilities
Component	Responsibility
GitHub Pages	Static website (HTML/CSS/JS)
Cloudflare Workers + KV	Backend, Stripe checkout, Printful API, order persistence
Stripe	Digital and physical payment processing, Payment Element, QR code payments
Printful API	Physical product catalog and fulfillment
Cloudflare DNS	Routing frontend and email
Titan Email	Business email (hi@example.com)



✅ Advantages of this setup

Fully serverless backend (no need to pay for traditional hosting)

Free tiers for GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Workers, and KV are sufficient for a small store

Supports Stripe Payment Element and QR code payments

Can scale later if needed
